        # if we use the asserEqual() then our value will raise that error and our test will think something failed.
        
        # method 2:
        # but testing the exceptions in the previous method is not recommanded
        # because sometimes it is easy to call the function of that we want to test normally
        # instead of passing all of the arguements separately like we are doing here.
        # and we can do this by using a context manager for the exception.
        # that will allow us to handle and check the exceptions properly and also call our function normally.

    # we can see that we get 4 dots and says that Ran 4 tests and lastly says OK.
    # and all of those tests passed with those assertEqual method.
    # so we can imagine how useful this is if we have a module with complicated functions,
    # then when we have write good test like this 
    # and then we can come here and see if all the programs run correctly or not.
    # so if we change something in our program and we think that it would work.
    # but if it broke our code, then our test should catch that.

    # for example, in our calc module's mul() function, we enter 2 * instead of 1
    # then if we come back our test_calc.py module run this,
    # we can see that in our output we have 2 dot and then a F and then again a dot
    # that means 3 of our test pass and one fails.
    
    # sometimes we might make a change that doesn't actually break our test, but unexpectedly break our code.
    # for example, in our calc module's div() function, we use the floor division(//) instead of regular division(/).
    # our current test wont catch this because right now all of our divisions are whole numbers.
    # so lets say some point floor division broke our code, 
    # and after some debugging we traced that and found that problem.
    # in that case it is a good practise to update our tests with the test that we have caught the error
    # so that we dont leave those same bugs again and again for future.
    # so lets update our test_div() function.

    # there is one more thing that we can see in our calc.py file.
    # we can see that we are checking that if the number we are divided by is 0 or not.
    # if so then we are raising a value error with the message that Can not divide by zero!
    # we likely want to test that if our expectation are working in that test as well.
    # but this is done a little differently that other assertions. 
    # there is actually 2 ways that we can do this. 
    " see above in the test_div() function"
